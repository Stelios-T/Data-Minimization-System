INTELLIGENT APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF DATA MINIMIZATION

The issue of privacy and data is becoming increasingly legislated and is one of the critical issues that concern modern societies. The degree and processing that has been collected with the development of technology is the main reason. To address these issues, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation. Among the basic principles of the Regulation is the principle of data minimization. The aim of this repository is to present a technical solution to the application of the minimization principle. In this context, it introduces an innovative system that exploits semantic web technologies in order to make real-time decisions about which data satisfy the minimization principle, i.e. are appropriate, relevant and necessary for the purposes for which they are submitted to processing.
